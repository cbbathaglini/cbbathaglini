<h2>About me</h2>
My name is Carine Bertagnolli Bathaglini, I am 26 years old, and I live in Brazil. I hold a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, and I currently work as a backend developer. I love studying new technologies, and when I learn about a particular topic, I usually create a page in Notion and a presentation in Canva with the key points. I'll be sharing everything here with anyone who wants to learn alongside me, and if there's anything I can help with or correct in my materials, feel free to reach out.
